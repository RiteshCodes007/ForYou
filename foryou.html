            Hey, I know you're not feeling the best right now, Whether you are missing home or college stress or something else, I just want you to know that I'm here for you. I hope you remember your promise to share everything with me, never suffer alone. I am always here if you want to share.<br><br>
            You are so strong and wonderful. Whatever it is, I know you’ll get through it, and I’ll be by your side every step of the way.<br><br>
            I love you more than words can say, and I'm sending you all my strength and positivity💪❤️. You are special and your dreams matter to me. And I pray for you every night before going to sleep.

        <div class="love-notes">
            <br>I love you more. More than all the good days. More than any distance. More than any fight. More than any perfection. More than I love myself. I love you more than everything. I still remember that moment when I said the word, when you and I became We.<br>
            <br>Then later that night You said Ritesh, you want to listen,
            I said Yes
            Then you said the words.
            That was one of the best moments of my life, My heart skipped a beat and the heartbeat raised high. But your love controlled it. I have saved everything and smile every time when I read it.<br>
            <br>
            I am making myself better every day, working out regularly, improving habits, focusing on my work, learning new ways of loving you, making you feel special and important because the person I love deserves the best. You are my motivation, and I am working hard, never think that I am not focusing on my work.

                Mai sukoon ban na chahta hun tumhara.<br><br>

                Wo ghar ban na chahta hun tumhara.<br><br>

                Tum thak gayi ho safar ke is mod par,<br>
                manzil ban na chahta hun tumhara.<br><br>

                Tumhare har raat ke andheron ko mita kar,<br>
                subah ban na chahta hun tumhara.<br><br>

                Tumhari aankhon ke aansuon ko chura kar,<br>
                sitare ban na chahta hoon tumhara.<br><br>

                Jo baat tumhare dil ko sukoon de,<br>
                wo geet ban na chahta hoon tumhara.<br><br>

                Jo Tumhe sirf khushiyon se bhar de,<br>
                wo Khwab bn na chahta hun tmhara.<br><br>

                wo aasman ban na chahta hun tumhara.<br><br>

                Choti choti baton ko bahut sochti ho,<br>
                chain ki neend ban na chahta hun tumhara.<br><br>

                Sirf tumhari muskurahat meri duniya ho,<br>
                wo chahat ban na chahta hun tumhara.<br><br>

                Tumhare nakhre mai nhi uthaunga to kaun uthayega,<br>
                Mujhpe apna gussa nhi nikalogi to kispe nikalogi.<br><br>

                Apni problems mujhse nhi bataogi to kis se bataogi.<br>
                tmhe hmesha sun skta hun mai.<br><br>

                Tumhari khushi ban na chahta hun,<br>

                Zindagi ke har mod pe saath nibhana chahta hun,<br>
                Tumhare har dukh ko apne dil se mitana chahta hun.<br><br>

                Har sawal jo tumhare mann mein hai bas gaya,<br>
                Main uska jawab ban na chahta hoon.<br><br>

                Tumhare har khwab ko pankh de kar,<br>
                Main tumhara aasman ban na chahta hoon.
